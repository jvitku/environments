HANNS project - Nodes for Simulated Environments
================================================


Author Jaroslav Vitku [vitkujar@gmail.com]


About
------

This is a part of Hybrid Artificial Neural Network Systems (HANNS) project (see: http://artificiallife.co.nf ). 

Each node can be connected into a potentially heterogeneous network of nodes communicating via the ROS, potentially Nengoros ( http://nengoros.wordpress.com ). 

This is ROS meta-package (currently without direct catkin support), a collection of ROS(java) nodes.

 
Purpose of this repository
-----------------------

This project holds environments and test cases for the HANNS. There should be both discrete (e.g. gridWorld) and continuous (Vivae) environments.


Technical notes
---------------


Installation
------------------

The best way how to install these nodes so far, is to use them as a part of the NengoRos project (see: https://github.com/jvitku/nengoros )

TODO
----------

- move the gridworld here
- move the Vivae simulator here
